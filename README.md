# semf - smart embedded framework
With the semf middleware library a lot of helpful modules and interfaces stand ready for your embedded projects. Because of the platform independency of all components, the source code can easily reused and projects can be ported so to say effortless.

## Characterizion
* Real C++ object orientation with open class architecture
* Reusable source code
* Platform independence
* Easily testable source code
* Less debugging
* Solves the big and small hurdles in everyday developer work

## Value proposition
* Saving of valuable developer time and cost reduction
* Significant reduction in time to market
* Fewer complaints and therefore happier customers
* Happier, more productive developers who enjoy coding more

To start using semf, see the [Guided Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVh0At-LjC8) and [Documentation](https://www.semf.io/embedded-wissen/).
